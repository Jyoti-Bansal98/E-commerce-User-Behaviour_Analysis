# E-Commerce User Journey & Funnel Analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
- Why do thousands of users add products to their carts but never complete the purchase?
- At which stage of the customer journeyâ€”browsing, adding to cart, or checkoutâ€”are users lost the most? 
- Which product categories drive revenue and which face the highest drop-offs?

In this project, I analyze an e-commerce dataset of 1 million events to map the user journey from product views to purchases using conversion funnels, drop-off analysis, and heatmaps. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that help businesses optimize product offerings, reduce cart abandonment, and improve overall user engagement.

## ðŸ›  Analysis Steps
1. Data Cleaning
   - Removed duplicates  
   - Handled missing values for category_code, brand, and category_id  
   - Standardized event_time and extracted features: event_hour, event_month, is_weekend  

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Count of event types  
   - Top categories, sub-categories, brands, and products  
   - Price distribution (histogram & boxplot)  
   - Repeat customer purchases  
   - Time-based analysis by hour, weekday/weekend, and month  

3. Conversion Funnel & Drop-Off Analysis
   - Conversion rates between view â†’ cart â†’ purchase  
   - Category-wise drop-off percentages  

4. Revenue Analysis
   - Top categories by revenue  
   - Pareto analysis

## ðŸ“Š Analysis & Key Visualizations
### 1. Event Type Distribution
- Majority of events are *views, followed by **purchases* and *cart additions*.  

### 2. Top Categories by Count
- Electronics and smartphones dominate user interactions; *unknown categories* also have high event counts.  

### 3. Top Brands
- Samsung, Apple, and Xiaomi lead in user engagement.  

### 4. Price Distribution

## ðŸ”‘ Insights & Key Findings
- *Event Funnel:* Highest conversion occurs at *cart â†’ purchase; major drop-offs occur at **view â†’ cart* stage.  
- *Top Revenue Categories:* Electronics generate the most revenue, while smaller categories cumulatively reach 100%.  
- *Repeat Customers:* Few users contribute to multiple purchases, highlighting loyalty potential.  
- *Time Patterns:* Peak purchase hours are *4â€“8 PM*; weekend impact is limited due to only two weekend days in dataset.

## ðŸ’¡ Business Recommendations
- Improve *checkout flow* to reduce cart â†’ purchase drop-offs.  
- Target marketing and promotions for *high cart but low purchase categories*.  
- Focus on *high-revenue categories* like electronics for campaigns and bundles.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This project analyzes *10 lakh rows of e-commerce data* to reveal patterns in user behavior from *views to purchases*.  
By combining *conversion funnels, category-level insights, and revenue analysis*, businesses can identify bottlenecks, optimize conversions, and increase revenue in a structured and actionable way.
